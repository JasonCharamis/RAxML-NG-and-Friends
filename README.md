**Scalable RAxML-NG-based phylogenetic analysis using Snakemake**

This is a Snakemake workflow for running scalable maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis using RAxML-NG and associated tools (Pythia, ModelTest-NG). This workflow is considerably slower than the IQ-TREE-based one, but is much better in terms of accuracy, especially in difficult-to-analyze datasets.

This workflow performs all steps sequentially, from MSA to model selection and phylogeny inference. 
To include custom options, edit the config/config.yaml file.

Usage:
snakemake --cores 20 --snakefile Snakefile

All dependencies are downloaded and installed through conda.

**To run this fully automated pipeline using Docker containers use the following commands**:
1. git clone https://github.com/JasonCharamis/Snakemake-workflow-for-RAxML-NG-based-phylogenetic-analysis.git
2. cd workflow/ && docker build -t automated_phylogenetic analysis . 
3. Travel to the directory where you have the desired fasta files (better only those)
4. docker run -it -v `pwd`:/workflow -w /workflow automated_phylogenetic_analysis snakemake --use-conda --snakefile Snakemake-workflow-for-RAxML-NG-based-phylogenetic-  
   analysis/workflow/Snakefile --cores 20

The last step may require sudo rights.
Of course, to customize the run edit the config/config.yaml file. 

That's it! The pipeline will run automatically.
